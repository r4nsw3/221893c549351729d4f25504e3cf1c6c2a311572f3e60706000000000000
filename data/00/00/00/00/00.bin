  |   The Cylons have rebelled!                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Four years of war and a steep price in human lives have not been      |
  |   enough to unlock a deadly stalemate. The Colonials have countered     |
  |   all of the Cylon's offensives so far, but no decisive victory was     |
  |   achieved.                                                             |

  |   The deadlock is suddenly broken by a surprise attack from the         |
  |   Cylons and the brutal annihilation of the Colonial Fleet High         |
  |   Command on Picon. The fate of mankind is now resting on the           |
  |   shoulders of Rear-Admiral Lucinda Cain.                               |

  |   The secret, cunning plan she has conceived could turn the tide of     |
  |   the war forever...                                                    |
